<h2>What is Media Literacy?</h2>
    <p>Media Literacy is a measure of your ability to understand and grapple with art, but for the purposes of this quiz, it's a measurement of your feelings towards video games, music, movies, television, the professionals who make them, and the corporations who employ those individuals. 
      <br><br />
    Some people might disagree with the axes measured in this quiz, but the questions presented are meant to evaluate your ability to acknowledge both the stories you experience and your overall understanding of modern art production.
      <br><br />
    You will be presented a statement, then answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value and give you a percentage.<br /><br />
    
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2><a id="anchor">How is this test measured?</a></h2>
    <p>There are five axes - Community, Art, Idiosyncracies, Progressivism, and Workers' Rights - each has two opposing values.</p>
    <div class="explanation_bg">
        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#3f51b5;">SINGLE PLAYER</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                  A high score on the Single Player scale means you prefer to consume media by yourself, often choosing to talk about it with friends only after you've spent time in isolation enjoying the media.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">
                <p class="axis_name">COMMUNITY</p>

            <div class="explanation_blurb_right">

                <p class="blurb-text">
                  A high Multiplayer score means you prefer group activities, often enjoying media that encourages collaboration or group participation: hit seasonal TV shows, the newest movies, and competitive multiplayer video games, as well as MMORPGs, are examples of this.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#005f73;">FINE ART</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                  A high score on the Fine Art scale means you care about art for art's sake, often preferring well designed pieces by artists who intend to make a statement with what they curate.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">

            <div class="explanation_blurb_right">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#ee9b00;">MASS PRODUCTION</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                  A high Mass Production score means you prefer art that can be more widely shared and disseminated. The most obvious night/day example here would be a Criterion Collection movie vs. Marvel's Avengers.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#0a9396;">UNIQUE STORIES</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                  A high score on the Unique Stories scale means you're a fan of narratives crafted in a bespoke, particular manner, rather than ones that rely heavily on tropes and trends to develop their characters and overarching plot.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">

            <div class="explanation_blurb_right">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#ca6702;">PROCEDURAL GENERATION</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                   A high Procedural Generation score means you'd prefer to have more content rather than unique content, so you're willing to overlook things like the reuse of assets, the re-release and remake of old, highly publicized shows & games, and the use of AI and algorithms for developing game worlds.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#91ceb9;">LITERATE</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                   A high score on the Literate scale means you're highly receptive to all forms of art, regardless of its construction or its biases, allowing you to look past your own lack of knowledge and use it to inform yourself on its construction. Literate people never balk at subtitles or color, rather choosing to use them as a part of the critique they construct when analyzing the work they consume.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">

                <p class="blurb-text">
                    A person with a high Reactionary score is someone highly resistant to art: they are often turned off by content that is complicated or initially difficult to read or engage with, and typically reject engagement over retreating to safer, more readily available and easily consumed content.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="blurb-text">
                    A high score on the Unionization scale means you're in favor of artists banding together to fight for better working conditions, higher pay, and better benefits. You might also believe there are significant problems with the way certain topics are handled, like sexual assault in the workplace.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">

                <p class="blurb-text">
                    A high Corporate Consolidation score means you're in favor of corporations having complete control over their product and IP, and that they should have free reign to dictate the working conditions of the workplaces that produce the art they sell to the public writ large.
                </p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 17pt;">What are the "identities" listed after the results?</h2>
    <p>Much like the original 8values quiz, this Media Literacy quiz attempts to match your score to a specific identity that's associated with certain online behaviors and communities. Some of the associated identities, like "Artificial Intelligence Fan" and "Gamergater", are linked to online movements; you may or may not agree with the label, but it should closely align with your answers. If you have feedback or think these results were wrong, contact me at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/archaicnoise.bsky.social">@archaicnoise.bsky.social</a> and I'll be happy to review the questions.</p>
